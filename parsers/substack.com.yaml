      text: "\n  Vicki’s note: This is a post by request from Rian, who runs the Elezea newsletter, which you should definitely check out. As always, please send me requests and juicy tech company tips. :)\n  Early last week, I was looking around for parenting advice, as I usually am at 3 in the morning these days. More specifically, I was looking for a way to make my older kid go to bed earlier so my husband and I can have ten minutes of peace between when she goes to sleep and the baby wakes up.\_\_\n  If you Google anything related to childcare advice, you’ll get a lot of commercial sites that pay childless copywriters to research online for five minutes and write filler content that optimizes for SEO ranking. Or you’ll find communities like The Bump, which used to be an amazing place to find moms asking for and giving advice. But, as of a couple years ago, it’s now hyperfocused on monetization, which means the forums and community features are much harder to find and search through.\_\n  My new go-to communities are now the beyondthebump and parenting subreddits, which are full of people who are just as sleepless and miserable as I am. And the most important thing is that they are all kind, semi-anonymous, and leave long, detailed notes about what they’ve done, what works for them, and what doesn’t.\_It’s the best to be able to commiserate with them, learn from them, and to not be constantly beset by advertising.\_\n  I found out from the parenting subreddits that what I needed was to buy my toddler a special sleep clock that would help her figure out when to go to bed. Fingers crossed; it’s coming soon from Amazon (with its requisite kipple.) \n  That subreddits are useful might come as a surprise to anyone who reads online news casually. Reddit is usually portrayed in the popular tech press as the last bastion of radicals, red pillers, and generally the very worst of anonymous internet society, where perverts roam the land:\_\n    Judging from his internet footprint, Brutsch, 49, has a lot to sweat over. If you are capable of being offended, Brutsch has almost certainly done something that would offend you, then did his best to rub your face in it. His specialty is distributing images of scantily-clad underage girls, but as Violentacrez he also issued an unending fountain of racism, porn, gore, misogyny, incest, and exotic abominations yet unnamed, all on the sprawling online community Reddit.\n  It’s so interesting and sad to me to read articles like these because I don’t recognize them as my Reddit at all. My Reddit – full of subreddits of helpful, funny, and interesting people – is exactly what’s missing from the rest of the internet in my opinion.\_\_\n  In a post about Reddit in 2015, I wrote,\_\n    Its mostly text-only format, no-nonsense posts, puns and humor abounding in the comments, and often generosity to complete strangers was a welcome relief from the shimmering sheen of the post-Facebook and Twitter socialized, “CLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE”, Buzzfeed-ized version of the monetized internet that I have come to hate.\n  Some of my absolute favorite subreddits (in alphabetical order) include:\n      Am I The Asshole- where people post situations and other people judge whether they were the jerk. The conversation is always surprisingly a lot more civil than you would imagine\n      Ask Historians, - where you can ask real historians hypothetical questions like “Before submarines were invented, how deep did people think the oceans were?\n      A Normal Day In Russia - a self-explanatory subreddit for people doing insanely stupid things in Russia\n      CS Career Questions - a discussion board that keeps somewhat of a pulse on the state of tech hiring\n      History Memes - what it says on the tin - memes made out of historical events\n      Philadelphia - Where I learn what’s going on in my city\n      Python - Also self-explanatory, provides more context and discussion of Python than the ephemeral Twitter community\n  And many, many more. It’s hard to find this type of content online anymore - meaty, deep content that doesn’t live in Twitter threads or on hyperbolic articles. And, just as importantly, content that’s dissaociated from people’s real online identities. \n  As I wrote in my piece on Reddit:\_\n    Because no real names are required, people are free to share all kinds of information. I’ve learned about everything from other women’s experiences with pregnancy, to the worst IT environments to work in, to the best books, to what a normal day in Russia is like, to what people looked like in 1914, to how to manage my finances, to what’s going on in my city, to why certain languages work the way they do, to reading actual professors write about history.\n  But Reddit, like the remnants of the old internet, is dying. Why?\_\n  The first reason is that good things don’t scale. As social media platforms have become larger and larger and need to maximize returns on VC investments, they become blander. In order to appeal to more people, you need to be as unoffensive as possible, something Facebook and its issues with content moderation has been finding out painfully for a bunch of years now. How does someone from one cultural background decide what is offensive for the whole world? How do you moderate something but not censor it? It’s a very hard issue, which is why the best groups and social networks are small and self-moderating.\_\n  Second, good content requires good moderation, which is an unpaid skill of emotional labor that’s not valued by the marketplace. Most good subreddits are run by moderators that perform thankless labors, and incur their own emotional costs in the process. The best moderators also know about their subject area. For example, to be a moderator in r/science, \n    you have to hold a Bachelor's of Science degree. \"Then we'll check and make sure they aren't a troll,\" Crocker explained.\_\n  A large-scale company conscientiously trying to pay all these people would, ostensibly, go bankrupt. Or, as is the case with Stack Overflow, who is also on the monetization bandwagon after recently hiring a CEO with a background in management consulting, get in a huge fight with moderators. \n  Finally, aside from moderation, it’s really hard to monetize the best parts of the internet because they don’t involve outrage and clickbait. They involve complicated discussions that people have to think about. Or, they’re weird and niche, and advertisers don’t want any part of that.\_ For example, how do you monetize a discussion on couplets in Paradise Lost?\n  Reddit particularly has struggled with this problem the whole time it’s been around, for precisely these reasons. \n  The Reddit ethos is inherently anonymous, cynical, and anti-censorship, which makes it anti-advertising:\_\n    Unfortunately for the website, selling advertisements poses two major problems. Since Reddit is built by and valued on the strength of its users, excessive advertising could lead to further censorship and drive community members to seek alternatives. In fact, on multiple occasions, user protests have occurred in the wake of attempts to institute changes that would pave the path to monetization.\_\n    Secondly, in an effort to keep the community happy and anonymous, Reddit does not require email addresses for account registration and does not track users’ personal data. Without obtaining more targeted data about its users and the high CPM revenue that flash and pop-up ads command, Reddit will not be able to increase its advertising revenue without upsetting their users.\_\n  Reddit is really trying though, most recently with New Reddit. New Reddit is a site redesign it rolled out this spring. New Reddit prioritizes visual content, removes the trademark wall of text that makes Reddit so valuable, and, ironically, takes much, much longer to load.\_\n  The idea behind new Reddit was that the Reddit c-suite wanted it to be much more welcoming to new users - aka, generic, bland, and Facebook-like:\_\n    The team's efforts mark the first visual refresh of Reddit in over a decade. Steve Huffman, Reddit's cofounder and CEO, signaled the need for a tidying-up in a post last year. \"Many of us evangelize Reddit and tell people how awesome it is, what an impact it's made in their life, how much it makes them laugh, etc, and then when those new people decide to check out Reddit for the first time they're greeted with dystopian Craigslist,\" Huffman wrote. \"We'd like to fix that.\"\n  The Normcore translation for this is that Reddit needs more money, quickly, and the redesign is the way to attract digital advertisers. \n  New Reddit looks just like New Facebook, New Twitter, and every other consolidating site that’s figured out how to monetize eyeballs in 2019.\_ New Reddit also sucks, and is terribly slow.\_\n    I've seen some posts stating that the new Reddit \"feels\" slow, but I thought I'd try quantifying it for myself. It's true, the new Reddit is twice as slow as the old version.\n    If I pop open the Inspector and look at the first GET request, old Reddit takes just under 1 second, whereas the new Reddit takes about 2 seconds. Just for the root page. This is compounded by the fact that the new Reddit downloads a lot more content after the initial load, which can cause a single page load to take upwards of 10 seconds in total. In contrast, a full page load takes 3-4 seconds with old.reddit.com.\n  As I’ve written, users always hate site redesigns but site redesigns, like Twitter’s recently, will make a ton of money because the site redesigns are for advertisers:\n    In this context, it’s not surprising that the new site redesign features sections that are clearly paths to get people to click on trending content, hashtags, and other pathways that are easier to measure for advertising purposes. The enormous pictures and video expansions that make it impossible to read more than 2-3 tweets at a time are to spur user engagement, which is always higher on visual media than plain text (From Vicki: I’ve found this to be true in my own experience of creating mediocre data science memes as well.)\n  Alas, new Reddit is going to make Reddit a TON of money, because advertisers will be able to understand it better and show more ads. \n  To see evidence of Reddit’s pinning everything on the future of the redesign, just look at who announced it The VP of Ads.\_ When a company tells you who they are, believe them. Who Reddit used to be was a site for The People. Who Reddit is now is a company desperately trying to make money to stay afloat and grasping at any straws it can find.\_\n  I said as early as 2015 that Reddit was dying, and it still is, now even more quickly than ever. \n  But, until it goes away entirely, you’ll still find me, at 3 am, on the beyondthebump parent subreddit, cherishing the little community that’s left on the internet in 2019.\_\n  Art: Death of Fedor Chizhov, Ilya Repin, 1877\n  What I’m reading lately\n       Thanks to Dan for sending me the link to this Substack, which discusses the issue I wrote about last week of keeping/deleting data. \n      Imgur readers are also fed up with ads. The meme hosting company has had to change its policy. \n      This machine learning community scandal would make a good….music video. \n      Consulting company tries to be cool.\n      This report on TV tracking \n          Arvind Narayanan@random_walkerWhen we watch TV, our TVs watch us back and track our habits. This practice has exploded recently since it hasn’t faced much public scrutiny. But in the last few days, not one but *three* papers have dropped that uncover the extent of tracking on TVs. Let me tell you about them.\n            September 27th 20193,846 Retweets5,362 Likes\n       RIP Madpreduce, the Hadoop engine: \n      @JeffDean @GCPcloud R.I.P. MapReduce.

      text: "\n  I first came across Siraj Raval around 2016, when a data scientist friend sent me his video. “This is ridiculous,” he said, and I had to agree that it was. But, it was also hilarious.\_\n  Who else was making funny, well-made music videos about machine learning?\_ It was nice to watch, because it’s always nice to see a humorous subculture develop around your discipline.\_ At the time, there was not a lot of funny data science content out there (unless you count my awful tweets, and those came much later).\_\_\n      Vicki B\U0001F383ykis@vboykisIt's only called a Neural Network if it comes from the Neuralè region of France. Otherwise you have to call it a logistic regression.\n        December 24th 20182,544 Retweets12,014 Likes\n  My interest was piqued.\_ At the time, Siraj had a couple of other videos on machine learning topics like Python and deep learning, and, thanks to YouTube’s ceaseless recsys pusher,\_ I watched them.\_\_\n  They seemed easy to get into, and really well presented video-wise, but very surface-level as far as concepts went. In the sea of data science content I was watching, I’d see his videos pop up from time to time as recommended related views, but I didn’t think about it any more than that.\_\n  Then, all of a sudden, a couple weeks ago, this news item came out, seemingly out of nowhere:\_\n    The AI hysteria has led to a rash of budding engineers hoping to land a cushy job somewhere in Silicon Valley.\n    So it's no wonder that thousands flocked to an online course titled Make Money with Machine Learning fronted by Siraj Raval, a self-proclaimed AI educator, rapper, and entertainer with nearly 700,000 subscribers on YouTube.\n    ...\n    But his reputation as a rising pop science star has been called into question after hundreds of students enrolled on his 10-week online course began demanding refunds. For $199, machine-learning enthusiasts are fed weekly video lectures, online quizzes and reading assignments to learn how they can make money by applying AI in various industries like finance, agriculture and healthcare.\n    Ray Phan, a senior computer-vision and deep-learning engineer at Hover, a 3D software startup based in San Francisco, told The Register that the lectures were confusing and contained mistakes. The online projects were too simplistic to be useful in the real world, and Raval was absent and unsupportive.\n    Even if he hadn't taken on so many students, the course was still received pretty poorly. Many claimed Raval had the habit of copying and pasting code taken from other people's GitHub repositories, or linking to some of his old content, and taking reading material publicly available on sources like Medium blogs.\n    Sven Niederberger, a mechanical-engineering student known as embersarc on GitHub, told El Reg that his code, simulating how to land a rocket with reinforcement-learning algorithms, was used in one of Raval's YouTube videos.\n  I was surprised. My first impression of Raval was that he may have been a little light on content, but definitely, judging by the quality of his video production and how much code he had on GitHub, someone with a background in machine learning and a serious data professional.\_\n  That’s what many others seemed to think, as well, because he got endorsements from many students, as well as famous people in the AI community:\_\n    Raval began his internet fame by uploading videos describing how to build a neural network in five minutes, how logistic regression or sentiment analysis works, and how to build Bitcoin or healthcare startups. His work has been praised by revered figures in the machine-learning community like DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, and shared by Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk too. So far, so good.\n  The Register does a really good job describing Raval’s videos, the courses, the subsequent confusion and refund process but what they don’t get into was: how did this happen? How did someone who set out to make machine learning accessible to everyone end up upsetting hundreds of students, machine learning content creators, and machine learning practitioners online? \n  And, more importantly, why did people in the industry, including the people at the top, promote this?\_The Register article doesn’t get into that much. So, I decided to dig a little deeper. And by digging a little deeper, I mean just conducted a bunch of Google searches to see what had really happened.\_\_\n  If you search for Raval, all of his own personal branding comes up first. And his personal branding, as the kids say these days, is lit. He has a really slick website. But, as with seemingly everything about Raval’s machine learning content, there is a lot of very well-executed flash and not a lot of content. What I was really looking for, was to understand his background.\_\n  That was a bit harder to find. Most of the podcasts and blogs that conduct interviews with him describe him as a “data scientist, best-selling author, and YouTube star”. But where did he work, doing what? How did he get into making machine learning videos?\_\n  It turns out that that he grew up in Houston and went to Columbia University, where he first majored in finance. After a semester-long suspension for stealing a laptop, he decided to “try to do something positive” and majored in computer science to become a software developer.\_\n  Based on Twitter, it doesn’t look like he ever finished his degree.\_\n      Siraj Raval@sirajravalI never graduated from Columbia, i'm a college dropout. And I've always stubbornly refused to get a PhD despite my parents wishes. Self directed learning will be valued more & more while college degrees will be valued less & less. The Internet is my University, make it yours too!\n        April 7th 2019675 Retweets4,121 Likes\n  According to his LinkedIn, he spent about one year each at a robotics firm in New York, Meetup.com, CSB Interactive, and Twilio.\_ His initial website has links to his work in iOS development and titles him as a “software developer.”\_\n  It’s important to note at this juncture that his LinkedIn pegs his time at Columbia as ending in 2012, 2013 at the latest. In 2016, a link to his YouTube channel, Sirajology, appears. This would have been at Twilio, where he was a “developer educator.” So, when he started down this path, of creating data science content, then, he had been out of college for three years. He was working as a developer, and didn’t have any data science experience.\_\n  Which is ok! Lots of people write tutorials for the sake of learning something and teaching others (Myself included. For example, when I wrote this Python type hints post, I had never used them in a project before).\_ In fact, I think more people closer to the beginning of their careers should write tutorials, because they remember beginner problems more clearly than senior people.\_\n  However, that’s not the way Siraj framed it from the beginning. Almost from the get-go, he positioned himself as someone who would teach you, rather than someone who was learning along with you.\_ He never gave his credentials. He projected an authoritative air.\n  And podcasters and others who interviewed him as he became more popular never asked to clarify.\_ And, more importantly, he never corrected them.\_\_\n  Many beginners were drawn in by the engaging content. Learning how to program, and data science in particular, is so popular these days that many people want to participate, to become a data scientist no matter what.\_ Anything that makes entry into the market easier is fantastic. Data science and machine learning are so full of dense terminology, software packages, arcane instructions, and academic language, that anything that makes it easier will instantly become popular.\_\n  And as more people watched these eye-candy videos,\_ YouTube’s merciless recommender algorithm, which would show one video from Siraj, showed more and more. Since beginners were likely to look for videos from stars in the field like Andrew Ng, and also clicked on Siraj’s viral content, more and more people were exposed to his content and became fans. His current channel is at almost 700k subscribers.\_\n  The thing grew and grew, until people like Elon Musk were retweeting his content, lending credibility, a fact that was proudly added to his site in 2017.\_\n  But the Machine Learning community on Reddit suspected something was amiss. In a thread from July of 2017 called, appropriately, “What do you guys think about Siraj Raval's videos on YouTube?”, the original poster asks,\_\n    I was watching a few lectures on YouTube about backpropagation in neural networks, because I've forgotten how exactly it was done in detail and wanted to brush up on it. Anyway, YouTube continued playing videos of Siraj Raval for some reason. So, I watched a few of his videos. I must admit I was rather bemused by his approach. He condenses ML subject matters down to things like \"TensorFlow in 5 Minutes\" or \"How to Predict Stock Prices Easily\". He talks to the audience like they are supposed to be beginners, but then proceeds to steamroll them with advanced topic information. He glosses over things and is very handwavy. Everything I've heard so far is correct, but I don't understand what or to whom it is useful for. I could follow his videos fine, but I've got plenty of education in this field, I just can't imagine being introduced to the subject mat[t]er like this.\n    …\n    Idk. Maybe I'm being too harsh. He is definitely knowledgeable and entertaining, and a cool guy. But how educational is his channel really?\n  Other commenters chime in that his shorter content is better, but that his longer content is not helpful, and that he takes from a lot of other tutorials without crediting them.\_\n  And then, there were curious comments like this one:\_\n    He's good for beginners but doesn’t really have any insight of his own. One video that I watched from him was him literally copying code from a blog tutorial and he just recites the intuition off a secondary screen that you cant see off-screen.\n  Finally, there was this one, which Siraj, replies to himself, with his own reddit handle (no longer active), “Yup, getting better at the math, thanks for the feedback.”\_\n  There were also signs in the public interviews he was giving, like this one, for The Startup, “Medium's largest active publication, followed by +511K people”:\n    The criticism mainly stems from the approach Siraj takes in his videos. His work is as much about educational content as it is about conveying the sheer excitement he has about the topic at hand. More often than not, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly where one ends and the other starts, giving the material a superficial feel. As a result, many shun him for being too superficial and lacking in technical depth. This is arguably true, but beside the point.\n    ….\n    This all is apparent from the approach he takes in creating his content. In a candid interview with Lex Fridman, Siraj mentioned that his ambition is to increase his subscriber count to a million, so as to reach more people. To get there, he meticulously monitors his analytics, mainly audience retention metrics, in order to pinpoint exactly what works and what doesn’t in his videos. One of his main findings is the importance of the relevancy of pop culture references, including jokes and memes. As such, he keeps an eye on mainstream channels like the previously mentioned PewDiePie and others, trying to relate AI to the timely themes that the youth find entertaining.\n    …\n    As for the future, Siraj is thinking about publishing books, coming out with an album, and starring in a Netflix show. Even fashion isn’t out of the question, he says. To him, these disparate mediums are just like different keys in the piano, different instruments in the orchestra of education. And just like many of the great composers in history, he, too, is ahead of his time.\n  As with the videos, all this press snowballed on itself, and he gained more and more followers, and with them, a larger, critical audience of people potentially with more experience in machine learning than he had.\_\n  When he was just starting out and small, no one was telling him that the math and the code were wrong. It seems like he was doing it, yes, to gain followers, but also to learn.\_ You can learn at 50 YouTube followers. You can’t learn when you have 700k. Which is maybe where he started copying and pasting code, to keep up.\_\n  The constant stream of ego boosts, likes, favorites, and video shares can grate on anyone. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have all said at some stages that they’re all thinking about removing likes from their platforms as part of the ongoing process to detoxify social media.\_\n  It’s one thing to expose adults to the platform: already bad. It’s another to expose someone fresh out of school to a constant stream of never-ending validation from people much less experienced in a field than he was. Put those two things together, and you get where Raval is now.\_\n  The bigger he got, the bigger he felt the need to become, particularly with so little working experience and so many people telling him he was amazing. It can’t have been easy to have been working in the warped echo chamber of the internet, particularly fed by retweets of Elon Musk and friends. All of this culminated in him creating his “School of AI” and then announcing his most recent course course, which brings us back to today.\n  What does it all mean? Was Siraj wrong? Or,\_ was he just trying to create AI content for the masses? Was he, as he notes on Twitter, trying to give back?\n      Siraj Raval@sirajravalNeither of my working class parents went to college and I grew up watching them struggle with finances. Throughout my life, certain people gave me opportunities to succeed. Now I'm paying it forward to the world\n        August 13th 201880 Retweets926 Likes\n  Or, was he exploiting students, convinced that data science was their ticket to riches (If you haven’t yet, please see my post on how it’s not)? Or was he just very shrewdly taking advantage of today’s internet, which values both hype around topics like machine learning, little fact-checking of technical work, popularity in favor of substance, and five-minute videos? Or maybe, he was just young, unprepared for the (very heavy!) responsibilities to teach hundreds of people in topics he himself was maybe not fully up on.\_\n  A little of all of the above, I think, and it’s this nuance that the Register story, and to some extent, the Reddit threads, don’t tease out.\_ It’s fully possible that Siraj was both cognizant that he was scamming students, but also not aware to the extent that he was hurting people, but also maybe not meaning to hurt people, and wanting to keep up with the reputation which had so far very much preceded him. It’s maybe all of this stress that led to the code copying.\_\n  So, where are we now with all of this?\_\n  So far, Siraj has said the following on his Twitter:\_\n      Siraj Raval@sirajraval1) i just saw posts about my recent ‘make money with machine learning course’ from some unsatisfied students and I’d like to apologize to each of them publicly. First, I’ll be sending refunds to the students who asked for one within 30 days of purchase immediately.\n        September 22nd 201914 Retweets262 Likes\n  He ends with,\_\n  “I’m feeling pretty low right now, but I’m in this for the long-haul. I understand that it will take time to rebuild trust, but I’ll work for it.”\n  The Register article notes that he’s in the process of issuing refunds,\_\n    At $199 a pop, having 1,200 students means a total of $238,800. That pile of cash has dwindled since Raval began refunding students and at least 250 of them have got their money back so far.\n  Which brings us to another point: Was this also the internet’s fault, just as much as it was his?\_\n  I’ve written previously about many things that are wrong with today’s internet: faulty recommendation systems that optimize for clickviews, the attention economy, and systems that need to constantly scale, thereby pushing for content that optimizes for excess rather than focused attention and learning. Siraj was, very smartly, able to capitalize on all of them, until he got to a point where he was in over his head.\_\n  He had all the skills necessary to command attention on the internet. But he didn’t yet have the underlying technical skills to actually teach the content, or organization skills to run a course for learners. All of this caught up to him in the end.\_\n  In a fair internet, someone in the data science community would have taken him aside quietly and told him that he should maybe reconsider, before he got to the point where he made the tech news. He would have had a maybe a physical or online community to bounce ideas off of.\n  But, as he notes in an interview, \n    I wake up at 7:30am, then I ride my bike to my co-working space. When I’m working, I like to be completely alone, I like to be in my own space and then I go home after like 6hours of working and then I will spend the rest of the day just kinda like alone, thinking of ideas so clearly, usually, I’m kinda in my own space but on weekends, I try to be more social.\n  It was just him, alone with his ideas, with the internet constantly expanding their reach without any recourse. Everyone (myself included) was just on the other end of the line, consuming the memes. \n  On top of all of this was the layer of AI and ML hype that is so pervasive in the industry today, that makes CEOs and students alike salivate, making new learners, particularly in emerging economies, desperate to shell over cash that grants them entry into what they perceive is the exclusive club of elite data scientists running super-cool algorithms. \n  And not only newbies. Just as recently as a couple of days ago, he was interviewing Vinod Khosla, the legendary VC, on AI. (As an aside, please read this fascinating and depressing story about Khosla and his battle to try to ban the public from walking by his house to get to the beach.)\n  Once the heady brew of hype is applied to technologies that are complicated to understand, even reasonable people can lose reason. In the same way that Elizabeth Holmes was young, without people around to ground her in reality and tell her “no”, and able to rise to the top by scamming high-level people who didn’t fact-check her complicated science behind her healthcare startup, Raval was able to get much farther than he probably would have in a reasonable ecosystem.\_\_\n  What’s the takeaway here, for ML people, for people in tech, for any reasonable person armed with today’s internet?\_\n      We need to provide people with the right tools and content to evaluate what they’re watching education-wise for tech topics\_\n      We need to end the hype cycle around AI and ML pronto. I’ve been pretty vocal about this myself, and one of the reasons I started this newsletter - to moderate the gushing fountain of both tech enthusiasm and tech negativity from the mainstream media.\n      We need to be critical of what we watch and read (easier said than done!)\n      We need to help people around us if we see they need technical boost, and to make ourselves availalable. We need to learn to offer constructive criticism outside the parameters of a sarcastic tweet or a one-off YouTube comment. In today’s internet, ultra-engineered for attention and outrage to push all our worst buttons as humans, it can be really hard on a daily basis, but we have to try. \n  I’m hopeful that Raval’s story gives more people pause before consuming things at face value, particularly in the data science realm.\n  And, I’m also hopeful that Raval can recover from this and learn the important lessons: First, don’t plagiarize code! Second, don’t overpromise and underdeliver. And third, don’t use Tensorflow. Just kidding. Third is, don’t wade in over your head. Ask for help.\_ Form a network and find mentors. \n  Siraj has a Q+A on YouTube today at 11 Pacific. I’m hopeful that he address some of this, and it helps him move forward, both for the sake of his own reputation and peace of mind, and for the industry and internet, as a whole.\_\n      Siraj Raval@sirajravalI'll be hosting a live Q&A on Youtube this Friday Oct 11 at 10 AM PST.

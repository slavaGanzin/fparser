             A personal note: after 6 years working for Andreessen Horowitz in Silicon Valley, I've moved back to London to explore new projects. Amongst other things, I'll be presenting a big macro tech trends presentation in Davos this week.

            üóû News
            Building the panopticon: a big NY Times splash on Clearview, a company that has scraped millions of people's photos and names from all over the web, indexed them into a database using face recognition, and is selling this to law enforcement, so that the police can upload a random photo and (probably) get a name. Lots of interesting issues here: 
            	US tech companies used to try to block and sue scrapers, until LinkedIn lost a lawsuit and the judge said that not only could they not sue, but also that they're not even allowed to try to block scraping by any technical means. Some people celebrated this as a triumph for free competition and the open web - welcome to the unintended consequences
            	At this stage face recognition is close to a commodity technology: if you can get the photos anyone can index them like this - indeed, a government could do this with driving licence or passport photos 
            	In some ways this is a rerun of concerns around databases in the late 1970s and early 1980s: databases and now machine learning mean that things that had always been theoretically possible on a small scale became practically possible on a massive scale. I wrote about this in September: Face recognition and the ethics of AI. 
            	Links: NYT story, LinkedIn scraping lawsuit from last year
            EU wants to pause face recognition: the EU is as usual in the vanguard on tech regulation: it's considering a temporary ban on facial recognition in public spaces. Link
            Privacy versus competition: Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies (i.e. cross-site behaviour and ad tracking) in Chrome (which has about 70% of desktop web traffic) within two years. Apple is already doing this in iOS's Safari, which has the majority of mobile web use in the USA. This will both protect privacy and reduce the value of current publisher ad models, such as, say, the NY Times, since they will know less about you. Of course, by pure conincidence this doesn't affect what happens within a single closed-loop site, such as for Google search/search advertising, or Facebook. In other words, by protecting privacy, Google (and Apple) make ads on Google and Facebook more attractive and weaken most other ad models. As for the previous story, privacy conflicts with competition. Link
            Amazon cracks down on fakes? There has been a wave of stories about fake or dangerous goods sold by third parties using Amazon's marketplace platform (which is now 60% of sales), and Amazon says it's cracking down. Marketplace was a genius move to allow Amazon to scale faster and add categories for less risk (it doesn't have to hire a team or build inventory), but if you let lots of third parties sell on Amazon, you'll get some crooks. And unlike eBay, where you understand you're not buying from eBay itself, Amazon doesn't really make clear the difference between buying from Amazon and just buying on Amazon. Link
            Edge AI chips: Apple bought Xnor.ai, which makes technology to make it easier to run machine learning models on small, low power devices instead of just in big datacentres. This is part of the future. Link
            üîÆ Reading 
            Editorial in the FT from Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, arguing for regulation of AI. This is part of a broader theme of big tech companies looking at social and political questions raised by their systems and saying that, well, politicians and society should decide. Link ($)
            Good roundup of CES from Jay Goldberg. Link

            More than 400,000 German jobs at risk in switch to electric cars (massively fewer moving parts - th biggest threat is probably in the supply chain. Link
            A nice piece trying to map workplace collaboration startups. So so many of these right now. Link
            Can end-to-end encrypted systems detect child abuse imagery? Maybe. Link

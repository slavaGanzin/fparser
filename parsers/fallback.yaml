      text: "\n              Telegram has notified investors that the TON blockchain project will be launched later than planned, pushing the deadline from Oct. 30 to April 30, 2020.\n              In an email to investors reviewed by CoinDesk, Telegram cited its recent run-in with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which obtained a restraining order prohibiting the messenger app company from launching TON and issuing gram tokens. The agency deemed grams to be unregistered securities.\n              The email, which was sent recently to investors in the second of Telegram’s two $850 million fundraising round from early 2018, says:\n                “We had intended to launch the TON network in late October. However, the recent SEC lawsuit has made that timing unachievable. We disagree with the SEC’s legal position and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit. We are proposing to extend the deadline date in order to provide additional time to resolve the SEC’s lawsuit and work with other governmental authorities in advance of the launch of the TON network.”\n              The additional time will be an advantage for companies working on applications for the TON network, Telegram said.\n              The deadline can be extended with the consent of investors holding a majority of the tokens bought in the round, the email says.\n              The two groups of investors, those who bought tokens in February 2018 and those who did so in March 2018, will need to approve the extension separately, and it’s possible that one group agrees to postpone while the other refuses:\n                “In these circumstances, we propose to make certain limited amendments to the terms of the purchase agreements that remain in place to reflect the fact that fewer Grams will be issued and in circulation on the Network Launch Date.”\n              Investors in the second round must sign a form approving the extension before\_Oct. 23. If the majority chooses not to sign, these investors can get back\_“approximately 77 percent” of their money.\n              The first-round investors received “a separate communication” from Telegram, the letter says.\n              If the deadline is extended, Telegram plans to spend another $80 million before April 30.\n              “We look forward to receiving your support to ensure we can proceed with our vision for TON,” the letter concludes.\n              On Oct. 11, the SEC obtained an emergency restraining order to halt the launch of TON. Soon after the company notified investors it might postpone the planned end-of-October launch to resolve the situation.\n              A court hearing in the case is scheduled on Oct. 24 in New York.\n              Telegram app\_image via Shutterstock\n"

            After yesterday’s post, someone on Twitter expressed concern about providing a “degraded experience” to users who have Save-Data enabled.
            It’s far from the first time I’ve heard this concern expressed. A user sees “Save Data” as an option and says, “Yeah, of course!” but they may not want a lesser experience as a result.
            It’s a fair concern, I think. We make a lot of decisions on people’s behalf online and certainly deciding to provide a degraded experience in this situation would be a questionable one.
            But it’s also an avoidable one. One of the things I think is so great about the Save-Data feature is that it gives companies some sort of control over how their brand is experienced in data-constrained environments. They’re not relying on a proxy service to do a bunch of manipulation on their behalf, hoping it turns out alright. Instead, they have an opportunity to be proactive and careful consider how they can provide a low-data experience that still reflects their brand in a positive light.
            There are endless ways you could do this without causing your the experience to feel lesser in any way. Here are a few ideas.
            Lower resolution images
            Often we serve high-resolution images to high-resolution screens. When the Save-Data header is enabled, we could instead serve up a lower resolution image by default.
            That’s exactly what Shopify is doing now. If I open the homepage with Save-Data off on my phone, the site weights 906kb. 292kb of that are images.
            If I pass the Save-Data header and reload the page, the site weighs 791kb, with 176kb of that being images. That’s a 12% drop in page weight. And visually, I frankly can’t tell the difference.
                One of these screenshots of the Shopify homepage loads high-resolution images, one doesn’t. Yet the two pages look virtually identical.
            This may not be the most significant change you could make, but it’s also one of the least intrusive. After yesterday’s post, Gatsby was super quick to get an issue filed for adding support to their gatsby-image plugin, and it looks like someone already submitted a PR for review to handle it.
            This is also something browsers could do by default, though it sounds like that isn’t the case so far.
            Fewer images
            Taking it a step farther, you could serve fewer images (something Jeremy Wagner recommends in his excellent article on Save-Data).
            One of my favorite examples to use here is a news site. I don’t know of one that does this currently, but it’s easy enough to imagine what it would look like.
            Take, for example, the BBC site. Like many news sites, you have some major stories with larger hero images, and then you have supporting stories with thumbnails for each. On my desktop, that’s 1.5MB of images.
            I went through and removed the thumbnails for the supporting stories and got that total down to 966kb of images. I was pretty conservative too. I didn’t touch any of the thumbnails used as backgrounds and didn’t touch any of the thumbnails related to videos. There’s plenty more that could have been shaved.
            As it is, the experience looks different, sure, but I would argue not in the least bit degraded. It’s still very clean and reflects nicely on the BBC brand.
            Remove web fonts
            Another example from Jeremy’s post (he’s smart, that guy) is to remove web fonts if Save-Data is turned on.
            Now, depending on the site and font in question, this may be a more controversial change to make. As always, your mileage may vary, you certainly don’t want to start implementing every optimization here without first considering if it’s right for your situation.
            But I would argue that more sites than not could get away with this, provided they took the time to have a solid fallback font stack in place.
            Take, for example, the CNN site. On the home page, CNN loads 6 different files for their CNN Sans font, totaling 251kb. (Let’s just ignore for a moment that they could probably cut a few out or do some subsetting to help reduce that a bit.)
            Falling back to Helvetica Neue, as they currently do, is a bit too jarring even for me. But falling back to Helvetica or Arial isn’t. There’s a difference, sure, and I do think the CNN font looks a bit better. But 251kb better when I need to save data? Probably not. Again, nothing here looks broken.
                The CNN site uses a web font (left) for text display, but falling back to Helvetica (middle) or Arial (left) has only a very minimal visual impact.
            You could probably do even better than this in most cases. I’ve had a lot of success using Monica’s Font style matcher tool to tweak different CSS properties to create fallback font stacks that are nearly indistinguishable from the original web font (often with similar results to what Harry has seen).
            Cut back on the ads and tracking
            Ok, I’ll be the first to admit this is a broader discussion around the business implications, but I promise you none of your visitors will complain if you decide to scale back a bit on the ads and tracking in a data-constrained situation.
            Some companies are already doing something similar when GDPR applies. USA Today is a notable example. Someone profiled their page soon after GDPR and found that while their site originally loads 5.2MB of data, the GDPR version only loads 500kb. That’s a massive data saving right there, and again, the site doesn’t feel broken in any way.
            Progressive enhancement without the enhancement
            If you build using progressive enhancement, Save-Data is a chance to consider maybe skipping a few of the enhancements. That’s not that far from the “cutting mustard” approach that was popularized by the BBC.
            Maybe leave the carousel out in place of a single image
            Maybe don’t load that extra JavaScript file that turns some of the static content into more dynamic interfaces.
            With progressive enhancment in place, not only would the change be pretty simple to implement, but you would also know that the experience you provide would work and look just fine. Because building with progressive enhancement means you’ve already considered what happens without those extra resources showing up.
            Less doesn’t mean broken
            That’s just a small set of ideas. The possibilities are endless. If you treat data as a constraint in your design and development process, you’ll likely be able to brainstorm a large number of different ways to keep data usage to a minimum while still providing an excellent experience. Doing less doesn’t mean it has to feel broken.
            You may even end up finding opportunities to apply those same considerations to your site, no matter if Save-Data is enabled or not.
            If you carefully consider the experience and treat data as a valuable resource not to be wasted, I don’t think anyone is going to be complaining.

                          (Image credit: BigStock/World Image)
                        In a recent interview, the head of Facebook’s Libra David Marcus warned that China’s digital payment system could be a real threat to US influence if regulators decide to stifle Libra, its stablecoin project.
                        China is racing ahead with the development of its central bank-issued digital fiat money even as US officials are trying to figure out how to regulate Libra, he added.
                        Why it matters: The Chinese central bank began accelerating development of a digital payment system that could eventually replace its fiat currency after Facebook released in June a whitepaper on its stablecoin project.
                        Facebook previously said it aims to launch Libra by next year. However, more recently it has seen overwhelming opposition from finance regulators in a number of European and Asian countries, as well as at home in the US.
                        The Chinese central bank meanwhile has been very vocal about the development of its digital currency/electronic payment system (DC/EP), though officials have not set a timetable for its release.
                        The DC/EP, designed to have a global reach, could help establish the Chinese yuan’s dominance. US officials have raised concerns about the Chinese yuan’s growing stature as a reserve currency amid the months-long trade war with China.
                        Details: If the US fails to come up with a good answer to digital currency in the next five years, the future will be China “re-wiring” a large part of the world, Marcus said in a recent interview with Bloomberg.
                        This could mean “a whole part of the world completely blocked from US sanctions and protected from US sanctions and having a new digital reserve currency,” Marcus said.
                          Can Facebook’s Libra replicate WeChat Pay’s digital payment dominance?
                        Context: Libra started a global conversation on digital currency adoption. However, it has received pushback from central banks around the world who fear that it may bring disruption to the current financial system.
                        Chinese central bank official said last month that its self-developed digital currency will bear some resemblance to Facebook’s Libra, which is likely to be banned in China once launched.
                        A quarter of the companies⁠—including Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal⁠—that initially agreed to take part in oversight have backed out. In September, Facebook revealed that the currency basket which will underpin Libra is absent the Chinese yuan.
                        Amid pushback, the controversial stablecoin project recently received some support from Foxconn founder Terry Gao who recently said that China’s likely refusal of Libra creates an opportunity for Taiwan to “become a place where the two separate systems converge.”

Made for iPhone hearing aids make it easy to personalise sound settings to your location. And Live Listen helps you have better conversations in loud places.\n                          Made for iPhone hearing aids\n                    Apple has worked with top manufacturers to create hearing aids and sound processors designed specifically for iPhone and iPad. These advanced hearing devices provide outstanding sound quality, offer many helpful features, and are as easy to set up and use as any other Bluetooth device. You can quickly access the features and settings of your paired hearing device by triple-clicking the Home button. Glance at the battery status or change the left and right volume, together or separately. And quickly apply your audiologist’s environmental presets as you go outdoors or enter noisy locations, like restaurants, without having to rely on additional remotes.\n                    Explore all models of Made for iPhone hearing aids\n                    Explore the US FCC’s hearing-aid compatibility (HAC) ratings of iPhone\n                    Learn how to set up Made for iPhone hearing aids\n                        Made for iPhone hearing aids\n                    Made for iPhone hearing aids, sound processors and now AirPods can help you have better conversations in loud places. Just turn on the Live Listen feature and move your iPhone towards the people you’re talking to.1 Live Listen uses the microphone to pick up what they’re saying more clearly.\n                    The Noise app tracks decibel levels of the ambient sounds around you, helping you identify when the levels could negatively impact your hearing. The information is stored in the Health app so you can refer to your data whenever you need\_it.\n                    When you’re using headphones, you may miss some audio if you’re hard of hearing or deaf in one ear. That’s because stereo recordings usually have distinct left- and right-channel audio tracks. iOS can help by playing both audio channels in both ears, and letting you adjust the balance for greater volume in either ear, so you won’t miss a single note of a concerto or word of an audiobook.\n                    You can use your iPhone to make and receive Textphone calls without the need for Textphone hardware. Transcripts for Textphone calls are saved in the call history of the Phone app. And there’s even a special keyboard that includes shortcut keys for common Textphone prompts such as “GA” and\_“SK”.\n                    iPhone lets you know when something’s up, in a way you’ll notice. It delivers both visual and vibrating alerts for incoming phone and FaceTime calls, new text messages, new and sent mail, and calendar events. You can set an LED light flash for incoming calls and alerts. Or have incoming calls display a photo of the caller.

      text: "\n  Managers of big mutual funds seldom expose their stock-laden portfolios to the highly illiquid private markets, but some of the fund industry's biggest players have drawn scrutiny in recent years for aggressive bets on some of Silicon Valley's boldest unicorns.\n  A series of flops by high-profile venture-backed companies journeying to the IPO market this year is a telling reminder of the risks that fund managers have accepted by blending a few high-flying private assets with their more staid publicly traded stocks.\n  WeWork's disastrous attempt at going public is the latest and most dramatic data point yet for widely held mutual fund companies like Fidelity, Vanguard and John Hancock that tagged lofty valuations on their shares in the co-working space provider. As of June 30, the top 10 mutual funds collectively owned WeWork shares worth almost $470 million, based on the fund managers' valuations, according to a PitchBook analysis of the most recent data available for that period.\n  Now those valuations are poised for a massive downward adjustment.\n  To stave off a cash crisis, WeWork is currently on life support after accepting a rescue package of financing from SoftBank that comes with a new valuation of $8 billion, or $19.19 a share.\n  That's a small fraction of the lofty levels that SoftBank and other investors placed on WeWork in late 2018—long before the company's doomed IPO.\n  Fund managers, however, have attached a wide range of valuations to WeWork. Hartford, John Hancock, and Principal put the company at an implied value of $42 billion, or $110 a share, in November of last year. Meanwhile, T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, the largest US fund manager, had implied valuations of $25 billion and $28 billion, respectively.\n  It's unclear whether mutual funds sold any of their WeWork shares as part of SoftBank's\_new financing. Later this month, fund managers are expected to begin disclosing their updated statements on their portfolio holdings as of Sept. 30—weeks before SoftBank took control of WeWork.\n  Most funds tend to shy away from private assets in part because of their need to maintain enough liquidity to accommodate a potential wave of investors seeking redemptions.\n  Only 5.8% of funds held some form of private assets as of December 2017, according to a study by fund tracker Morningstar. (PitchBook is a Morningstar company.)\_Those that do make private investments usually have well under 5% of their portfolio exposed to such companies, and that figure is capped by regulators at a maximum of 15%.\n  Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Hartford funds in recent years have made the industry's biggest commitments to private-market shares, as managers sought higher returns in an era with fewer new stocks coming onto the public markets. Since 2015, that has led fund managers to buy into many of Silicon Valley's hottest, high-growth startups like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Pinterest and Slack.\n  Representatives of Fidelity, John Hancock, T. Rowe Price and other big mutual funds holding WeWork shares declined to comment about individual stocks in their portfolios. But they said that investment committees using proprietary methods establish the fund company's price benchmarks and review them on a quarterly basis. SoftBank didn't respond to a request for comment.\n  Mutual fund managers making such investments are walking a fine line between traditional fund management and more aggressive, riskier forms of alternative investments outside their core competency, said Derek Hageman, a financial analyst with the American Association of Individual Investors, an educational group based in Chicago.\n  \"They're not VCs. They're not PE investors. They're mutual funds,\" Hageman said.\n  To be sure, although fund managers are bracing for a mighty markdown on their WeWork stakes, such shares make up a relatively small allocation in heavily diversified portfolios, so their overall negative impact is limited.\n  Fidelity's Contrafund, a large-growth fund with assets of almost $115 billion, initially invested about $214 million in WeWork in 2015 with a purchase of 6.5 million shares at $32.89 apiece, according to Contrafund's monthly fund disclosure.\n  More than a year later, the fund added 2.2 million shares priced at $50.19 and then took some profits with two separate rounds of share sales, resulting in a realized gain of about 58%. Factoring in WeWork's newest financing and a share price of $19.19, Contrafund's shares are facing a 43% discount to their original purchase price. Even with realized gains from earlier partial sales, Contrafund still faces a loss of 29% on its overall position since its entry into WeWork.\n  All the while,\_Contrafund currently has an 18% return year-to-date, according to Morningstar. Other notable private companies in Contrafund's portfolio as of Aug. 30 included vacation rentals platform Airbnb, genetic-testing specialist 23andMe and direct-to-consumer shoe company Allbirds.\n  The results look a bit rosier at Vanguard's US Growth Fund, which first bought 517,000 shares of WeWork at a more appealing entry point of $16.65. Vanguard already has sold 33,000 shares at $51.81, but its last available valuation put its WeWork shares at $68, which would represent an unrealized loss of 72%, assuming a newly reset valuation of $19.19 per share.\n  In light of Wall Street's sour reception of deals this year from the likes of WeWork, Uber and Peloton, fund managers may see some fresh criticism about whether they applied adequate screening of private assets in line with industry practices.\n  \"Even if a fund manager invests a relatively modest amount of capital in private placements, the kinds of companies that manager invests in says something about his or her process,\" said Alec Lucas, a senior analyst with Morningstar.\n  He said that enough concerns had emerged about WeWork's business model that \"one has reason to question the level of due diligence\" and judgment the funds have applied.\n  \"Even the best active managers make mistakes,\" said Lucas, \"but some mistakes are more telling than others. Investing in WeWork is a telling mistake.\"\n"

      text: "\n    I’d be remiss in not stating the obvious: Harvey Weinstein is a despicable human being, who did evil things. It’s worth noting, though, the structure of Hollywood that made it possible for him to do so much evil with such frequency for so long.\n    The Structure of Hollywood\n    There has always been a large “supply” of movie actors, directors, script writers, etc.; Los Angeles is famous for being a city of transplants, particularly young men and women eager to make a go of it in show business, certain their breakthrough opportunity is the next audition, the next script, the next movie pitch.\n    The supply of movies, though, is limited. These two charts from Stephen Follows tell the story. First, the number of feature films:\n    Then, the number of studio versus non-studio films:\n    Back in 1980, shortly after the creation of Weinstein’s Miramax production company, there were just over 100 movies release in US cinemas a year; in 2016, there were 736, but for “wide Studio releases” — Weinstein’s territory — there were only 93. Suppose there are five meaningful acting jobs per movie: that means there are only about 500 meaningful acting jobs a year. And Weinstein not only decided who filled many of those 500 roles, he had an outsized ability to affect who filled the rest by making or breaking reputations.\n    Weinstein was a gatekeeper, presented with virtually unlimited supply while controlling limited distribution: those that wished to reach consumers had to accede to his demands, no matter how criminally perverse they may have been. Lauren O’Connor, an employee at the Weinstein Company, summed up the power differential that resulted in an internal memo uncovered by the New York Times:\n      I am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career. Harvey Weinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.\n    What made Hollywood’s structure particularly nefarious was the fact that selecting actors is such a subjective process. Movies are art — what appeals to one person may not appeal to another — making people like Weinstein cultural curators. If he were to not select an actor, or purposely damaged their reputation through his extensive contacts with the press, they wouldn’t have a chance in Hollywood. After all, there were many others to choose from, and no other routes to making movies.\n    All the News That’s Fit to Print\n    Jim Rutenberg, the New York Times’ media columnist, highlighted Weinstein’s press contacts in a follow-up piece entitled Harvey Weinstein’s Media Enablers:\n      The real story didn’t surface until now because too many people in the intertwined news and entertainment industries had too much to gain from Mr. Weinstein for too long. Across a run of more than 30 years, he had the power to mint stars, to launch careers, to feed the ever-famished content beast. And he did so with quality films that won statuettes and made a whole lot of money for a whole lot of people.\n    Sharon Waxman, a former reporter for the New York Times, said on The Wrap that the New York Times itself belonged on that list:\n      I simply gagged when I read Jim Rutenberg’s sanctimonious piece on Saturday about the “media enablers” who kept this story from the public for decades…That’s right, Jim. No one — including The New York Times. In 2004, I was still a fairly new reporter at The New York Times when I got the green light to look into oft-repeated allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein…The story I reported never ran.\n      After intense pressure from Weinstein, which included having Matt Damon and Russell Crowe call me directly to vouch for Lombardo and unknown discussions well above my head at the Times, the story was gutted. I was told at the time that Weinstein had visited the newsroom in person to make his displeasure known. I knew he was a major advertiser in the Times, and that he was a powerful person overall.\n    Weinstein’s alleged pressuring of the New York Times —\_and his ability to influence the media generally — rested on the fact that the media is also a gatekeeper. The New York Times still brags as such in its print edition:\n    “All the News That’s Fit to Print” is rather clear about how the New York Times’ views itself: the arbiter — that is gatekeeper — of what news ought to be consumed by the public. In truth, though, by 2004 that gatekeeper role was already breaking down; perhaps the most famous example involved another set of allegations of sexual misconduct, when in 1998 the Drudge Report reported the news that Newsweek wouldn’t:\n    The gate could not hold.\n    The Structure of Newspapers\n    After Waxman’s post, New York Times’ editor-in-chief Dean Baquet argued that “it is unimaginable” that her story was killed due to pressure from Weinstein; in fact, though, an examination of the structure of the newspaper business suggests it is quite imaginable.\n    In 2004, the New York Times had $3.3 billion in revenue, up 2.4% year-over-year. That increase, though, belied deeper problems: circulation had dropped a percentage point year-over-year; revenue growth came from a 6% increase in adverting rates. Advertising was the New York Times’ primary revenue source, accounting for 66% of total revenue, and given that in 2003 the average Hollywood movie spent an average of $34.8 million in advertising, some portion of that undoubtedly came from Weinstein specifically.\n    The reason that circulation decline suggested a problem is that the ability of the New York Times and other newspapers to command advertising depended on being a gatekeeper: advertisers didn’t take out newspaper ads because they loved newspapers, they took out newspaper ads because it was an effective way to reach potential customers:\n    “Gatekeeper” is another way to say “integrator”, and as I have explained previously, the key to the newspaper business model was controlling distribution and integrating editorial content and ads. In 2004, though, that integration was the verge of falling apart; the Internet meant advertisers would reach customers directly. It had already happened with Craigslist and classifieds, and first ad networks and then social networks would do the same to display ads, causing newspaper advertising revenue to plummet to levels not seen since the 1950s:\n    2004 came after that first Craigslist-inspired decline, and it’s all too easy to imagine Weinstein’s threats having their intended effect.\n    Journalism Worth Paying For\n    The ultimate credit for the New York Times story goes first and foremost to the women willing to go on the record, and then to Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the reporters who investigated and wrote it. If Waxman’s allegations are true, though, then it’s worth pointing out that the New York Times is in a very different place than it was in 2004.\n    Last year the New York Times had $1.6 billion in revenue, a 53% decrease from 2004. Critically, though, the source of that revenue had flipped on its head: advertising accounted for only 37% of revenue, while circulation was 57%, up from 54% in 2015, and only 27% in 2004; by all account circulation is up significantly more in 2017.\n    That image is from the company’s 2020 strategy report, which declared that the editorial product should align with the company’s focus on subscriptions; Baquet told Recode that it was his job “to do as many ‘Amazons’ as possible”, referring to the paper’s investigative report on Amazon’s working conditions. Certainly this Weinstein piece fits: whatever expenses the New York Times spent reporting this story will be more than made up in the burnishing of the company’s reputation for journalism that is worth paying for.\n    Admittedly, “Journalism worth paying for” doesn’t have the same ring as “All the News That’s Fit to Print”, but it is a far better descriptor of the New York Times’ new business model:\n    In a world where the default news source is the Facebook News Feed, the New York Times is breaking out of the inevitable modularization and commodification entailed in supplying the “news” to the feed. That, in turn, requires building a direct relationship with customers: they are the ones in charge, not the gatekeepers of old —\_even they must now go direct.\n    YouTube and the Movies\n    In the aftermath of the New York Times report (and another from The New Yorker), various stories have alluded to the fact that Weinstein has less power than he used to. I can’t say I know enough about the particulars of Hollywood to know whether that it true in a relative sense, but there’s no question movies are less important than ever before. Indeed, the industry looks a lot like newspapers in 2004; revenue is increasing due to higher prices, even as the number of movie-goers steadily declines (graph from The Numbers):\n    Meanwhile, more and more cachet — and star power — is flowing to serialized television, particularly distributors like Netflix and HBO that go directly to customers. And don’t forget YouTube: video is a zero sum activity — time spent watching one source of video is time not spent watching another — and YouTube showed over a billion hours of video worldwide every day in 2016.\n    YouTube represents something else that is just as important: the complete lack of gatekeepers. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on an earnings’ call earlier this year that “Every single day, over 1,000 creators reached the milestone of having 1,000 channel subscribers.” That is an astounding number in its own right; what is even more remarkable is that while Hollywood has only ~3,500 acting slots a year (including all movies, not just major studios), YouTube creates 100 times as many “stars” over the same time period.\n    The End of Gatekeepers\n    It is easy to see the downsides of the destruction of gatekeepers; in 2016, before the election, I explained how the collapse of media gatekeepers meant the collapse of political gatekeepers. From The Voters Decide:\n      There is no one dominant force when it comes to the dispersal of political information, and that includes the parties described in the previous section. Remember, in a Facebook world, information suppliers are modularized and commoditized as most people get their news from their feed. This has two implications:\n      All news sources are competing on an equal footing; those controlled or bought by a party are not inherently privileged\n      The likelihood any particular message will “break out” is based not on who is propagating said message but on how many users are receptive to hearing it. The power has shifted from the supply side to the demand side\n      This is a big problem for the parties as described in The Party Decides. Remember, in Noel and company’s description party actors care more about their policy preferences than they do voter preferences, but in an aggregated world it is voters aka users who decide which issues get traction and which don’t. And, by extension, the most successful politicians in an aggregated world are not those who serve the party but rather those who tell voters what they most want to hear.\n    I can imagine there are many that long for the days when the media — and by extension the parties — could effectively determine presidential nominees. The Weinstein case, though, is a reminder of just how rotten gatekeepers can be. Their very structure is ripe for abuse by those in power, and suppression of those wishing to break through; consumers, meanwhile, are taken for granted.\n    For my part, I’m thankful such structures are increasingly untenable: perhaps the New York Times didn’t spike that 2004 story because of pressure from Weinstein, but there’s no doubt that for decades “All the News That’s Fit to Print” was shamefully deficient in reporting about news and groups that weren’t on the radar of New York newspaper editors. And, selfishly, I wouldn’t have the career I do without the absence of gatekeepers: anyone can set up a website and send an email and instantly compete with the New York Times and everyone else for attention and subscription dollars.\n    Most importantly, though, the end of gatekeepers is inevitable: the Internet provides abundance, not scarcity, and power flows from discovery, not distribution.1 We can regret the change or relish it, but we cannot halt it: best to get on with making it work for far more people than gatekeepers ever helped — or harassed.\n    And fortunately, to date, those that own distribution —\_the aggregators —\_have tried to be neutral; that’s a good thing [↩]\n"

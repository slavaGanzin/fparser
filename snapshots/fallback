The agency deemed grams to be unregistered securities.</p>\n              <p>The email, which was sent recently to investors in the second of Telegram’s two $850 million fundraising round from early 2018, says:</p>\n              <blockquote>\n                <p>“We had intended to launch the TON network in late October. However, the recent SEC lawsuit has made that timing unachievable. We disagree with the SEC’s legal position and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit. We are proposing to extend the deadline date in order to provide additional time to resolve the SEC’s lawsuit and work with other governmental authorities in advance of the launch of the TON network.”</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>The additional time will be an advantage for companies working on applications for the TON network, Telegram said.</p>\n              <p>The deadline can be extended with the consent of investors holding a majority of the tokens bought in the round, the email says.</p>\n              <p>The two groups of investors, those who bought tokens in February 2018 and those who did so in March 2018, will need to approve the extension separately, and it’s possible that one group agrees to postpone while the other refuses:</p>\n              <blockquote>\n                <p>“In these circumstances, we propose to make certain limited amendments to the terms of the purchase agreements that remain in place to reflect the fact that fewer Grams will be issued and in circulation on the Network Launch Date.”</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>Investors in the second round must sign a form approving the extension before Oct. 23. If the majority chooses not to sign, these investors can get back “approximately 77 percent” of their money.</p>\n              <p>The first-round investors received “a separate communication” from Telegram, the letter says.</p>\n              <p>If the deadline is extended, Telegram plans to spend another $80 million before April 30.</p>\n              <p>“We look forward to receiving your support to ensure we can proceed with our vision for TON,” the letter concludes.</p>\n              <p>On Oct. 11, the SEC <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/sec-halts-telegrams-1-7-billion-unlawful-token-issuance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">obtained</a> an emergency restraining order to halt the launch of TON. Soon after the company <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/telegram-could-postpone-crypto-issuance-after-us-halts-token-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">notified</a> investors it might postpone the planned end-of-October launch to resolve the situation.</p>\n              <p>A court hearing in the case is scheduled on Oct. 24 in New York.</p>\n              <p><em><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/kazan-russia-07082016-iphone-5s-telegram-696916558?src=JGVGzuBkBpuNzYOI-cD7Ag-1-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Telegram app</a> image via Shutterstock</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </section>\n\n        </article>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>"

A user sees “Save Data” as an option and says, “Yeah, of course!” but they may not want a lesser experience as a result.</p>\n\n    <p>It’s a fair concern, I think. We make a lot of decisions on people’s behalf online and certainly deciding to provide a degraded experience in this situation would be a questionable one.</p>\n\n    <p>But it’s also an avoidable one. One of the things I think is so great about the Save-Data feature is that it gives companies some sort of control over how their brand is experienced in data-constrained environments. They’re not relying on a proxy service to do a bunch of manipulation on their behalf, hoping it turns out alright. Instead, they have an opportunity to be proactive and careful consider how they can provide a low-data experience that still reflects their brand in a positive light.</p>\n\n    <p>There are endless ways you could do this without causing your the experience to feel lesser in any way. Here are a few ideas.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"lower-resolution-images\">Lower resolution images</h2>\n\n    <p>Often we serve high-resolution images to high-resolution screens. When the Save-Data header is enabled, we could instead serve up a lower resolution image by default.</p>\n\n    <p>That’s exactly what <a href=\"https://shopify.com/\">Shopify</a> is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brend0/status/1166875340603633664\">doing now</a>. If I open the homepage with Save-Data off on my phone, the site weights 906kb. 292kb of that are images.</p>\n\n    <p>If I pass the Save-Data header and reload the page, the site weighs 791kb, with 176kb of that being images. That’s a 12% drop in page weight. And visually, I frankly can’t tell the difference.</p>\n\n    <figure class=\"banner\">\n      <img src=\"https://timkadlec.com/images/shopify-comparison.png\" alt=\"One of these screenshots of the Shopify homepage loads high-resolution images, one doesn&rsquo;t. Yet the two pages look virtually identical.\">\n      <figcaption>\n        <p>One of these screenshots of the Shopify homepage loads high-resolution images, one doesn’t. Yet the two pages look virtually identical.</p>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n\n    <p>This may not be the most significant change you could make, but it’s also one of the least intrusive. After yesterday’s post, Gatsby was super quick to get an <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/17202\">issue filed for adding support to their gatsby-image plugin</a>, and it looks like someone already submitted a PR for review to handle it.</p>\n\n    <p>This is also something browsers could do by default, though it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoavweiss/status/1167186791524392975\">sounds like that isn’t the case so far</a>.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"fewer-images\">Fewer images</h2>\n\n    <p>Taking it a step farther, you could serve fewer images (something <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/save-data/\">Jeremy Wagner recommends</a> in his excellent article on Save-Data).</p>\n\n    <p>One of my favorite examples to use here is a news site. I don’t know of one that does this currently, but it’s easy enough to imagine what it would look like.</p>\n\n    <p>Take, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/\">BBC site</a>. Like many news sites, you have some major stories with larger hero images, and then you have supporting stories with thumbnails for each. On my desktop, that’s 1.5MB of images.</p>\n\n    <p>\n      <picture class=\"center\">\n        <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/cnn-with-thumbs.webp\">\n        <img src=\"https://timkadlec.com/images/cnn-with-thumbs.jpg\" alt=\"The CNN home page, with a hero image for the main story and thumbnails for each of the supporting stories.\">\n      </picture>\n    </p>\n\n    <p>I went through and removed the thumbnails for the supporting stories and got that total down to 966kb of images. I was pretty conservative too. I didn’t touch any of the thumbnails used as backgrounds and didn’t touch any of the thumbnails related to videos. There’s plenty more that could have been shaved.</p>\n\n    <p>\n      <picture class=\"center\">\n        <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/cnn-wo-thumbs.webp\">\n        <img src=\"https://timkadlec.com/images/cnn-wo-thumbs.jpg\" alt=\"The CNN home page, with a hero image for the main story and thumbnails removed from each of the supporting stories.\">\n      </picture>\n    </p>\n\n    <p>As it is, the experience looks different, sure, but I would argue not in the least bit degraded. It’s still very clean and reflects nicely on the BBC brand.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"remove-web-fonts\">Remove web fonts</h2>\n\n    <p>Another example from Jeremy’s post (he’s smart, <a href=\"https://jeremy.codes/\">that guy</a>) is to remove web fonts if Save-Data is turned on.</p>\n\n    <p>Now, depending on the site and font in question, this may be a more controversial change to make. As always, your mileage may vary, you certainly don’t want to start implementing every optimization here without first considering if it’s right for your situation.</p>\n\n    <p>But I would argue that more sites than not could get away with this, provided they took the time to have a solid fallback font stack in place.</p>\n\n    <p>Take, for example, the <a href=\"https://cnn.com/\">CNN site</a>. On the home page, CNN loads 6 different files for their CNN Sans font, totaling 251kb. (Let’s just ignore for a moment that they could probably cut a few out or do some subsetting to help reduce that a bit.)</p>\n\n    <p>Falling back to Helvetica Neue, as they currently do, is a bit too jarring even for me. But falling back to Helvetica or Arial isn’t. There’s a difference, sure, and I do think the CNN font looks a bit better. But 251kb better when I need to save data? Probably not. Again, nothing here looks broken.</p>\n\n    <figure class=\"banner\">\n      <img src=\"https://timkadlec.com/images/cnnwebfonts2.png\" alt=\"The CNN site uses a web font (left) for text display, but falling back to Helvetica (middle) or Arial (left) has only a very minimal visual impact.\">\n      <figcaption>\n        <p>The CNN site uses a web font (left) for text display, but falling back to Helvetica (middle) or Arial (left) has only a very minimal visual impact.</p>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n\n    <p>You could probably do even better than this in most cases. I’ve had a lot of success using <a href=\"https://meowni.ca/\">Monica’s</a> <a href=\"https://meowni.ca/font-style-matcher/\">Font style matcher</a> tool to tweak different CSS properties to create fallback font stacks that are nearly indistinguishable from the original web font (often with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/1156629153875156992\">similar results to what Harry has seen</a>).</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"cut-back-on-the-ads-and-tracking\">Cut back on the ads and tracking</h2>\n\n    <p>Ok, I’ll be the first to admit this is a broader discussion around the business implications, but I promise you none of your visitors will complain if you decide to scale back a bit on the ads and tracking in a data-constrained situation.</p>\n\n    <p>Some companies are already doing something similar when GDPR applies. USA Today is a notable example. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fr3ino/status/1000166112615714816?s=19\">Someone profiled their page</a> soon after GDPR and found that while their site originally loads 5.2MB of data, the GDPR version only loads 500kb. That’s a massive data saving right there, and again, the site doesn’t feel broken in any way.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"progressive-enhancement-without-the-enhancement\">Progressive enhancement without the enhancement</h2>\n\n    <p>If you build using progressive enhancement, Save-Data is a chance to consider maybe skipping a few of the enhancements. That’s not that far from the <a href=\"https://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard\">“cutting mustard” approach</a> that was popularized by the BBC.</p>\n\n    <p>Maybe leave the carousel out in place of a single image</p>\n\n    <p>Maybe don’t load that extra JavaScript file that turns some of the static content into more dynamic interfaces.</p>\n\n    <p>With progressive enhancment in place, not only would the change be pretty simple to implement, but you would also know that the experience you provide would work and look just fine. Because building with progressive enhancement means you’ve already considered what happens without those extra resources showing up.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"less-doesn-t-mean-broken\">Less doesn’t mean broken</h2>\n\n    <p>That’s just a small set of ideas. The possibilities are endless. If you treat data as a constraint in your design and development process, you’ll likely be able to brainstorm a large number of different ways to keep data usage to a minimum while still providing an excellent experience. Doing less doesn’t mean it has to feel broken.</p>\n\n    <p>You may even end up finding opportunities to apply those same considerations to your site, no matter if Save-Data is enabled or not.</p>\n\n    <p>If you carefully consider the experience and treat data as a valuable resource not to be wasted, I don’t think anyone is going to be complaining.</p>\n\n  </section>\n</article>"

However, more recently it has seen overwhelming opposition from finance regulators in a number of European and Asian countries, as well as at home in the US.</li>\n                  <li>The Chinese central bank meanwhile has been very vocal about the development of its digital currency/electronic payment system (DC/EP), though officials have not set a timetable for its release.</li>\n                  <li>The DC/EP, designed to have a global reach, could help establish the Chinese yuan’s dominance. US officials have raised concerns about the Chinese yuan’s growing stature as a reserve currency amid the months-long trade war with China.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <p><b>Details: </b>If the US fails to come up with a good answer to digital currency in the next five years, the future will be China “re-wiring” a large part of the world, Marcus said in a recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-17/facebook-warns-washington-that-beijing-wins-if-libra-plan-fails\">interview</a> with Bloomberg.</p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>This could mean “a whole part of the world completely blocked from US sanctions and protected from US sanctions and having a new digital reserve currency,” Marcus said.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YZ7Ib7uotv\">\n                  <p><a href=\"https://technode.com/2019/06/28/facebook-libra-replicate-wechat-pay/\">Can Facebook’s Libra replicate WeChat Pay’s digital payment dominance?</a></p>\n                </blockquote>\n                <p><iframe title=\"“Can Facebook’s Libra replicate WeChat Pay’s digital payment dominance?” — TechNode\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://technode.com/2019/06/28/facebook-libra-replicate-wechat-pay/embed/#?secret=YZ7Ib7uotv\" data-secret=\"YZ7Ib7uotv\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n                <p><b>Context: </b>Libra started a global conversation on digital currency adoption.

In September, Facebook revealed that the currency basket which will underpin Libra is <a href=\"https://technode.com/2019/09/24/chinese-yuan-excluded-from-facebooks-libra-currency-basket-report/\">absent</a> the Chinese yuan.</li>\n                  <li>Amid pushback, the controversial stablecoin project recently received some support from Foxconn founder Terry Gao who recently <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/taiwan-should-embrace-libra-says-foxconn-founder-201910160926\">said</a> that China’s likely refusal of Libra creates an opportunity for Taiwan to “become a place where the two separate systems converge.”</li>\n                </ul>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"post-footer post-footer-light style-light no-top-padding double-bottom-padding\">\n                <div class=\"post-share\">\n                  <div class=\"detail-container margin-auto\">\n                    <div class=\"share-button share-buttons share-inline only-icon\"></div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg-4\">\n              <div class=\"uncol style-light\">\n                <div class=\"uncoltable\">\n                  <div class=\"uncell double-bottom-padding\">\n                    <div class=\"uncont\">\n\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row-container row-navigation row-navigation-light\">\n      <div class=\"row row-parent style-light limit-width\">\n        <nav class=\"post-navigation\">\n          <!-- .navigation -->\n        </nav><!-- .post-navigation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</article>"
